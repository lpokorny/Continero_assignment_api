1)

values used in parameters are defined on Class level for convenience, if there were to be more tests, with diverse values,
it might be a better idea to hardcode the data in each test or to move them into separate file
where we would define all values we want to use for each parameter in a list


2)

There could be other asserts depending on what we are trying to test,
but I don't want to crowd the test if I'm not specifically asked for it in assignment

Example:

for link in printed_links:
    try:
        assert link.endswith(".jpg")
    except AssertionError:
        logger.error(
            "Link might not be an image as it doesn't end with '.jpg', manual inspection needed")
        raise

3)

to align with assigned task, assert on line 60 should be asserting, that 5 photos are printed, but I want it to be parametrized
and modular, so we can change page size and print any desired number of links without raising assert exception

4)

'Also, check that NASA records with keyword Mars taken in 2018 with media_type="video" includes !!only!! links to videos'
'Hint: search results includes a collection of links, which has to !!contain!! link to video file type'

- this part of assignment feels  poorly described... it might have two meanings:
Either we are to assert, that only video links should be present in the record including collection.json of the record,
or we are to assert, that between all the links in the record and its collection.json, there should be some video link/s

I decided to satisfy the second option, as it makes more sense to me and will make a passing test
